# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project: Analyzing the Fluctuations of Bitcoin and Ethereum

This repository contains the code and analysis for the Google Data Analytics Capstone Project, focusing on comparing the cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze the market dynamics and fluctuations of Bitcoin and Ethereum and provide insights into their investment potential. By examining various factors such as price movements, trade volumes, and historical data, I aim to assist potential investors in making informed decisions within the cryptocurrency market.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into several phases following the 6 steps of Data Analysis. Each phase includes specific tasks and analysis techniques to derive meaningful insights from the data. The phases are as follows:
1. Ask
2. Prepare
3. Process
4. Analyze
5. Share
6. Act

## Getting Started
To run the code and reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/geniusmuzammil/Google_Data_Analytics_Capstone_Project.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Google_Data_Analytics_Capstone_Project`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Open the Jupyter Notebooks in the `Notebook/` directory and run each cell to execute the code.

## Results and Conclusions
The project aims to provide insights into the comparative analysis of Bitcoin and Ethereum, focusing on their market trends, price fluctuations, and potential investment opportunities. The generated reports and visualizations will help users gain a deeper understanding of the cryptocurrency market and make informed decisions regarding their investments.

## Future Steps
Although this capstone project provides a comprehensive analysis of Bitcoin and Ethereum, there are always opportunities for further exploration and refinement. Some potential future steps include:
- Exploring additional variables and factors that influence the performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum.
- Incorporating sentiment analysis or social media data to assess the impact of public sentiment on cryptocurrency prices.
- Applying advanced machine learning techniques for price prediction or anomaly detection.

Please feel free to explore the project, provide feedback, and adapt the code for your own analysis or research purposes.
